Explanation:
HTML: The registration form includes fields for username, email, password, and password confirmation. It uses basic form elements like input and button. The footer contains the text "Made by Usama Rabi."

CSS: The form has a simple and clean design with a container that has padding, a subtle box shadow, and rounded corners. The form elements (inputs and button) are styled to look modern, and there is a hover effect on the submit button.

This form is responsive and should look great on all devices. Feel free to modify the colors, fonts, or layout to suit your needs!
